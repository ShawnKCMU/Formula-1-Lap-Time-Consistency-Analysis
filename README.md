# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting driver performance in racing events using historical lap time data. By exploring statistical relationships between various racing metrics and applying machine learning techniques, the project aims to classify drivers as consistent or inconsistent and uncover insights valuable for team strategies and decision-making.

## Features

* *Data Preprocessing*: Cleaning and normalization of racing data, including handling missing values and outliers.
* *Feature Engineering*: Calculation of key metrics such as average lap times and standard deviation of lap times.
* *Pearson Correlation Analysis*: Exploration of statistical relationships between racing metrics.
* *Driver Performance Classification*: Categorization of drivers based on their consistency in lap times.
* *Insightful Analysis*: Drawing actionable insights to inform racing strategies and driver evaluations.
